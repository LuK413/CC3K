# CC3K

Project by Zayaan Moez, Malcolm Yeh and Kai Lu for CS246 Spring 2019

Todo (not in order):
- [x] Basic player and enemy classes
- [] Dragon (needs DragonHoard and BarrierSuit)
- [] Dragon and Merchant hostility
- [x] Basic attack/combat calculation
- [] Special attack abilities
- [] Player class specialities (gold multiplier, potion effect for Elf)
- [] Basic Items
- [x] Map creation and player movement
- [] Random generation of enemies, items, compass, stairs
- [] Potion Buff Decorator on Player class
- []
- []
- []

If there is time:
- [] Merchant can sell items (ex: Broadsword gives permanent attack through multiple floors)
- Swords (calls new constructor that takes in Atk field so Atk carries through floor)
- Shields
- Lifesteal item (override dealDamage so it heals for % of damage dealt)
- Bow and Arrow (attack range becomes 2 instead of 1), probably hard to implement though
- [] Lottery machine: spawns in random level, allows player to gamble HP or Gold for more Gold
- [] BLOOD! When enemy dies, colour the tile '.' RED'
